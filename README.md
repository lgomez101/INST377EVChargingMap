# INST 377 Project - a Maryland Electric Vehicle (EV) Distribution Map

## Live Links
Github Repository: https://github.com/lgomez101/INST377EVChargingMap
Link to Hosted Page: https://lgomez101.github.io/INST377EVChargingMap/

## Functionality
Before data can be displayed on the map featured in the center of the page, the user needs to filter the data being presented.
The filters allow for the user to load data based on Year and Month of dataset, followed by the type of EV that the user wishes to view (100% Electric Vehicles or Hybrid Plug-ins).
No data will be displayed if the user filters for future data (Such as December 2023 As of the writing of this (5/11/23))
