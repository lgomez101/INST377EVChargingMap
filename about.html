    <h2>Description about the functionality</h2>
    <p>I wanted to create a lightweight website that would serve as an easy way to display the distribution of Electric Vehicles in Maryland, helping to address the issue I witnessed where it feels like there is a significant gap between chargers and EV's, leading to deserts where there's no where to charge, If I were to present this issue to Charging Station companies in the future, it would be a quick way to present up-to-date information or historical trends, which can influence where they choose to construct new ones in order to accomodate for the constantly growing count</p>
    <h2>Libraries Used in Project</h2>
    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <p><strong>Main - Leaflet.JS Choropleth Map <a href='https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/'>Link to Library</a></strong></p>
    <p>Although I wasn't able to fully implement all of the features that I wanted, my website still accomplishes what I set out to do in my original proposal, displaying a "hotspot" map where most EV's are located in Maryland</p>
    <h3>APIs</h3>
    <p><strong>Maryland.Gov - Maryland Political Boundaries - ZIP Codes - 5 Digit <a href='https://data.imap.maryland.gov/maps/maryland-political-boundaries-zip-codes-5-digit'>Link to GEOJSON</a></strong> </p>
    <p>This GEOJSON was downloaded due to the delays it caused live-downloading it on my website, the file is roughly 28MB, it was easier to have it locally available instead of waitng for it to download each time</p>
    <p><strong>Maryland.Gov - MD MDOT/MVA Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle Registrations by Zip Code <a href='https://opendata.maryland.gov/Transportation/MD-MDOT-MVA-Electric-and-Plug-in-Hybrid-Vehicle-Re/tugr-unu9'>Link to API Dataset</a></strong></p>
    <p>This is the Dataset that the website primarily works with, it's used to fill in the data to display on the map featured on the website</p>
